Scene 1 Prompt:

Create a compelling corporate office scene that vividly illustrates the pain points of traditional hiring. Feature a specific HR manager character: female, mid-30s, shoulder-length brown hair in a professional bun, wearing a navy blue business suit with a white blouse, oval-shaped glasses, with visible stress lines and exhaustion. She should be sitting at a cluttered wooden desk drowning in scattered paper resumes, with multiple computer monitors showing overflowing email inboxes (500+ unread messages), a large wall calendar with red "URGENT" markings and missed deadlines circled, and a digital clock prominently displaying 8:47 PM. Use harsh, fluorescent lighting to create a stressful, overwhelming atmosphere. Show this manager frantically sorting through physical resumes with highlighters and sticky notes, surrounded by empty coffee cups and takeout containers. Include multiple screens with overwhelming amounts of data, complex spreadsheets, and a calculator displaying "$15,000+ in lost productivity costs" and "3 weeks behind schedule." The office should have dim lighting, scattered documents, and convey complete chaos and inefficiency. The manager should look physically exhausted, rubbing her temples, with visible frustration while manually reviewing each resume. Show the pain points: missed deadlines, overwhelming workload, and the time-consuming nature of traditional hiring processes. Include visual stress indicators like a headache medicine bottle and a "Help Wanted" sign on the door.

VOICE-OVER SCRIPT: "Every day, I'm drowning in resumes. 200 applications for one position, and I have to manually review each one. It's taking me 3 weeks just to screen candidates, and by then, the best ones are already hired. My CEO is asking why we can't fill positions faster, and honestly, I don't have a good answer. This traditional hiring process is killing our productivity and costing us thousands in lost time."

Scene 2 Prompt:

Create a dramatic transformation scene that showcases the Hirios solution with cinematic flair. Show the EXACT SAME HR manager character: female, mid-30s, shoulder-length brown hair in a professional bun, wearing a navy blue business suit with a white blouse, oval-shaped glasses, but now with a radiant, confident expression and perfect posture. She should be sitting at a sleek, minimalist desk made of premium glass and chrome in a modern, open-concept office. The desk should feature a large 27-inch curved monitor displaying the Hirios AI dashboard with animated candidate scoring cards, real-time fit percentages (85%, 92%, 78%), and dynamic AI insights. Include stunning AI visualization elements like holographic data points, animated progress bars, flowing data streams, and floating success indicators around the screen. The manager should sit with executive presence, wearing a confident smile, surrounded by bright, natural lighting streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows. Show the Hirios platform interface with real-time candidate analysis, AI processing indicators, and professional dashboard elements. The workspace should be spotlessly organized with modern furniture, living plants, and represent the complete solution to hiring problems. Include subtle Hirios branding elements and show this same manager interacting confidently with the AI-powered system, with smooth animations and success metrics appearing in real-time.

VOICE-OVER SCRIPT: "Then I discovered Hirios. It's like having an AI hiring assistant that never sleeps. The platform automatically analyzes every resume against our job requirements, giving me objective scores and detailed insights in minutes, not weeks. Suddenly, I can focus on what matters most - building relationships with top candidates instead of drowning in paperwork."

Scene 3 Prompt:

Create a cinematic split-screen comparison that tells a compelling transformation story. Show "BEFORE" (the chaotic desk from scene 1 with the SAME HR manager character: female, mid-30s, shoulder-length brown hair in a professional bun, wearing a navy blue business suit with a white blouse, oval-shaped glasses, stressed expression, dim lighting and scattered resumes) on the left with visual pain indicators like stress, chaos, and exhaustion. On the right, show "AFTER" (the organized Hirios dashboard from scene 2 with the EXACT SAME manager character but now confident and empowered, bright lighting) with success indicators and efficiency. Then transition to full-screen showing the streamlined AI hiring process in action with dynamic animations. Display multiple candidate profiles being processed simultaneously with real-time scoring numbers appearing (85%, 92%, 78%), time savings metrics dramatically flashing "3 WEEKS â†’ 3 DAYS" and cost savings prominently showing "$50,000+ ANNUALLY SAVED" with animated dollar signs. Include AI scoring visualization with animated charts, strengths analysis bars, and demonstrate the voice interview feature with a microphone icon and AI conversation bubbles. Show the transformation from manual chaos to AI-powered efficiency with smooth, professional animations. Include success indicators like green checkmarks, progress bars filling up, and this same manager efficiently reviewing multiple candidates at once. The scene should clearly demonstrate the dramatic improvement in hiring efficiency and productivity with compelling visual storytelling.

VOICE-OVER SCRIPT: "The transformation was incredible. What used to take me 3 weeks now takes 3 days. I'm seeing 80% time savings on screening, and the AI is 90% accurate in identifying top candidates. Instead of spending hours on each resume, I get instant fit scores, strengths analysis, and even AI-powered voice interviews. We're hiring faster, smarter, and saving over $50,000 annually in recruitment costs."

Scene 4 Prompt:
Create a powerful, inspiring final scene that drives action with the EXACT SAME HR manager character: female, mid-30s, shoulder-length brown hair in a professional bun, wearing a navy blue business suit with a white blouse, oval-shaped glasses, now standing confidently in a premium, executive office setting that represents success and leadership. The manager should be positioned center-frame with a commanding, trustworthy presence and a warm, confident smile. Prominently display the Hirios logo in the background with sophisticated glowing effects and show multiple success metrics and growth charts floating on screens behind them with animated data visualization. Use warm, golden-hour lighting streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows to create trust and success. The manager should appear accomplished and authoritative while delivering a compelling call-to-action. Include clear visual elements for requesting a demo with animated buttons, hover effects, and show how AI-powered hiring can revolutionize recruitment with floating success indicators and achievement badges. The office should have premium finishes, executive furniture, and success symbols like awards, certificates, and growth charts. The atmosphere should convey future success, professional growth, and industry leadership. End with a strong call-to-action for the Hirios platform, showing this same manager pointing toward the future with confidence and determination, with the Hirios logo prominently displayed and a clear path forward illuminated.
