# Company Setup Page Refactor - Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Tab-Based UI Structure**
- Replaced single-page sections with **2 tabs**:
  - **Tab 1: Company Information** - Company name, website, description, size, industry, address, phone, and logo upload
  - **Tab 2: Email Configuration** - All SMTP settings (host, port, user, password, from email, from name, secure connection)

### 2. **Manual Save Functionality**
- **Removed auto-save** (5-second timeout mechanism)
- Added **dedicated save button** for each tab:
  - "Save Company Information" button in Company Information tab
  - "Save SMTP Configuration" button in Email Configuration tab
- Each tab saves only its relevant fields to the database

### 3. **SMTP Test Protection**
- Test Connection and Send Test Email buttons are **disabled until SMTP configuration is saved**
- Warning message displays when SMTP is not saved: "⚠️ Please save your SMTP configuration before testing the connection"
- Ensures test buttons always use saved database values, not unsaved form values

### 4. **Performance Improvements**
- **No more auto-saving every 5 seconds** - eliminates unnecessary database writes
- **Faster page load** - removed auto-save status indicators and timeout logic
- **Reduced re-renders** - simplified state management
- localStorage still used for draft persistence (unsaved changes warning)

### 5. **User Experience Enhancements**
- **Clear visual organization** with tabs
- **Success toasts** after saving:
  - "✅ Saved Successfully - Company information has been saved"
  - "✅ Saved Successfully - SMTP configuration has been saved. You can now test the connection."
- **Unsaved changes warning** only when leaving the page (not when switching tabs)
- **Stay on current tab** after saving to allow continued editing

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Removed: `lastSaved`, `isAutoSaving`, `autoSaveTimeoutRef`
- Added: `isSaving`, `smtpSaved`, `activeTab`

### New Functions
- `saveCompanyInfo()` - Saves company fields only
- `saveSMTPConfig()` - Saves SMTP fields only and enables test buttons

### React Hooks
- All `useEffect` hooks moved before early returns to comply with React hooks rules
- Added dependency for `hasUnsavedChanges` in profile check effect

### UI Components
- Imported and used `Tabs`, `TabsContent`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger` from shadcn/ui
- Maintained all existing form fields and validation

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Better Performance** - No auto-saving reduces database load
2. ✅ **User Control** - Explicit save actions give users control
3. ✅ **Cleaner UI** - Organized tabs make the form less overwhelming
4. ✅ **Safer Testing** - Test buttons only work with saved configurations
5. ✅ **Faster Load Times** - Simplified logic and removed unnecessary state updates
