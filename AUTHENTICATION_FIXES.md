# Authentication and Access Control Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Toggle Button Access Control (FIXED)
**Problem**: Job seeker accounts could see the toggle button to switch between Job Seeker and Company views, which is incorrect logic.

**Solution**: Modified `src/pages/JobPortal.tsx` to hide the toggle button for authenticated job seekers:
- **Before**: `{!user && (...)}` - Only showed for unauthenticated users
- **After**: `{(!user || (user && userType === 'company')) && (...)}` - Shows for unauthenticated users OR authenticated companies

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Desktop navigation
{(!user || (user && userType === 'company')) && (
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-3 bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded-lg">
    // Toggle button content
  </div>
)}

// Mobile navigation
{(!user || (user && userType === 'company')) && (
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center space-x-3 bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded-lg mx-auto w-fit">
    // Toggle button content
  </div>
)}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Security Checks Added (FIXED)
**Problem**: Job seekers could potentially access company-only features through direct URL access.

**Solution**: Added security checks to company-only pages:

#### CompanyView Component
- Added check to prevent job seekers from accessing company dashboard
- Shows "Access Denied" page with proper navigation

#### CompanySetup Page
- Added check to prevent job seekers from accessing company setup
- Redirects to job portal with appropriate message

#### ScreeningResults Page
- Added check to prevent job seekers from accessing AI screening results
- Shows access denied page with navigation options

**Code Pattern**:
```typescript
const { user, userType } = useAuth();

// Security check: Only allow companies to access this view
if (!user || userType !== 'company') {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 to-blue-50 flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="text-center">
        <div className="text-6xl mb-4">üö´</div>
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Access Denied</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">This area is only available for company accounts.</p>
        <Button onClick={() => navigate('/job-portal')}>
          Go to Job Portal
        </Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Email Verification Issue (NEEDS MANUAL SETUP)
**Problem**: New job seeker accounts are not receiving verification emails.

**Root Cause**: Supabase email verification requires configuration in the dashboard.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive setup guide in `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_SETUP.md`

**Required Actions**:
1. Configure email templates in Supabase dashboard
2. Set up SMTP settings or enable built-in email service
3. Test email verification flow
4. Monitor email delivery rates

2. **Verify Email** ‚Üí Click link in email (requires Supabase setup)
3. **Sign In** ‚Üí Access job seeker portal
4. **No Toggle Button** ‚Üí Cannot switch to company view
5. **Cannot Access Company Features** ‚Üí Security checks prevent access

### Company Flow (FIXED)
1. **Register** ‚Üí Account created (needs email verification)
2. **Verify Email** ‚Üí Click link in email (requires Supabase setup)

## Security Improvements

- Proper navigation options
- Consistent error handling

### 3. Database-Level Security
