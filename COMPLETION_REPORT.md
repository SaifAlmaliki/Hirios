## 🚀 Next Steps (Required)

### 1. Apply Database Migration ⚠️ REQUIRED

```bash
cd supabase
npx supabase migration up
```

Or manually run the SQL from:
`supabase/migrations/20250213000000_add_smtp_config_to_company_profiles.sql`

### 2. Configure Email Provider

**Quick Test (5 minutes):**
1. Use Gmail with App Password (easiest)
2. Enable 2FA and create App Password
3. Go to: http://localhost:8080/company-setup
4. Configure:
   - SMTP Host: `smtp.gmail.com`
   - SMTP Port: `587`
   - SMTP Username: `your-email@gmail.com`
   - SMTP Password: `your-app-password`
   - From Email: `your-email@gmail.com`
   - From Name: Your Company

### 3. Test Email Sending

Test all three types:
- ✅ Invite button → Voice interview email
- ✅ Reject button → Rejection email
- ✅ Send Offer → Offer email with PDF

## 📊 Build Status

✅ **Build: SUCCESSFUL**
- No linter errors
- No TypeScript errors

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Environment Variables (DEPRECATED)
These are **NO LONGER NEEDED**:
```bash
VITE_SCREENING_WEBHOOK_URL
VITE_REJECT_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL
VITE_OFFER_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL
```

You can remove them from your `.env` file.

### 2. Interview Scheduling Emails
**NOT affected by this change**. Interview scheduling still uses Supabase Edge Functions (separate system).

### 3. Production Considerations

**Nodemailer in Browser:**
- For production SMTP, consider moving email logic to Supabase Edge Function
- Current implementation is suitable for MVP/testing

**Security:**
- Email credentials stored in database (plaintext)
- Consider encryption for production
- Use environment variables for additional security

**Domain Verification:**
- Always verify your domain with email provider
- Configure SPF/DKIM/DMARC records
- Prevents emails going to spam
